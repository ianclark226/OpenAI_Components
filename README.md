# OpenAI_Components

These small apps were created with React and Node.

This is a list of AI Components that have been created with a third party API called OpenAI. The current list follows:

1. A Chat GPT app using Node.js

2. A Image Generator that you put in a description of what you would like and it would crate an image in seconds. This created image is not found online.

3. A keywork extractor where the user can put in a paragraph and clicking a bottom would take out all the important/key words. This would help with youtube, twitch, etc.
